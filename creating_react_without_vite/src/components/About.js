      (1979–2003) At the age of four, Babu visited the sets of the Telugu film
      Needa (1979) where its director Dasari Narayana Rao shot a few sequences
      of his as a part of the narrative in the presence of the former's brother
      Ramesh.[non-primary source needed] Needa marked his debut as a child
      actor.[citation needed] In 1983, he acted in Poratam (1983) upon being
      requested by its director Kodi Ramakrishna.[17] He went on to act as a
      child artist in the films Sankharavam (1987), Bazaar Rowdy (1988), Mugguru
      Kodukulu (1988) and Gudachari 117 (1989). He played a dual role in the

      1999, Babu made his debut as a lead actor with the romantic comedy
      Rajakumarudu, and people began referring to him with the title Prince.[18]
      For his performance, he received the Nandi Award for Best Male Debut.[19]
      He starred in two films the following year – Yuvaraju and Vamsi.[citation
      needed] He also starred in Krishna Vamsi's Murari (2001) which he regarded
      as an important film in his career and the role he played in it one of his
      favourites.[20][failed verification][21] For his role in Murari, he earned
      a Nandi Special Jury Award, in addition to his first nomination for the
      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[19] In 2002, his performance in
      Takkari Donga landed him his second Nandi Special Jury Award.[19] He had
      two film releases in 2003, the first one being Gunasekhar's Okkadu
      co-starring Bhumika Chawla.[22] He won his first Filmfare Award for Best
      Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[23] The other release was
      Nijam co-starring Rakshita.[24] Babu received praise from critics for his
      performance in the film, with Vijayalaxmi of Rediff.com calling him the
      only reason to watch the film's second half which she termed "a routine
      tale of vendetta".[25] He won his first Nandi Award for Best Actor for his
      performance in the film, in addition to his third nomination for the
      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[26] Mainstream film (2004–2010) In
      2004, Manjula produced his next film,[citation needed] Naani, directed by
      S. J. Surya co-starring Amisha Patel. While its simultaneously shot Tamil
      version New featuring a different cast proved to be commercially
      successful, Naani flopped at the box office.[20][non-primary source
      needed] He received his third Nandi Special Jury Award for his performance
      in his next film, Arjun, directed by Gunasekhar and produced by
      Ramesh.[27] The film released on 18 August 2004[28] and was successful at
      the box-office.[29] The film was screened at the International Film
      Festival of India in the mainstream section. This was Keerthi Reddy's
      final acting performance prior to her retirement from the film
      industry.[30] He chose to act in Trivikram Srinivas's Athadu (2005),
      co-starring Trisha Krishnan, whose script had been approved back in 2002
      before the production of Naani and Arjun had begun.[31][non-primary source
      needed] It emerged as one of the highest-grossing films of the
      year.[32][33] The film proved to be a major boost for Babu's career as he
      received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor –
      Telugu, in addition to fetching his second Nandi Award for Best Actor for
      his performance in the role of a hired assassin.[34] The movie collected a
      share of ₹22 crores at the box office.[citation needed] Idlebrain.com gave
      it a rating of 3.25/5 and mentioned Mahesh Babu is stylish and brilliant
      as professional killer.[35]Cinegoer.net gave a review stating, "True the
      film gives an image of a Hollywood base for the drama. Even the taking,
      screenplay structure and execution of scenes, less talk and more
      action.[36] He then collaborated with Puri Jagannadh in 2006 for the film
      Pokiri, which was jointly produced by Jagannadh and Manjula.[37] He
      received high praise for his performance, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The
      Hindu opining that "Mahesh's understated performance in Pokiri allows him
      effortlessly to reclaim the title of a star, overshadowing his
      questionable career choices of late".[37] He won his second Filmfare Award
      for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film.[38] That same
      year, his next film, Sainikudu, was released.[39] A critic from Rediff.com
      wrote that "Nonetheless, Sainikudu can be watched at least for its premise
      of letting the warrior in each individual surface, and the fact that it is
      done with the idea of motivating people to do something for their fellow
      humans".[40] The following year saw Babu acting in the film Athidhi,
      co-starring Amrita Rao, marking her Telugu debut. The film was produced by
      Mahesh Babu's's brother Ramesh.[41] UTV Motion Pictures acquired the
      film's distribution rights for ₹18.5 crore, which became its first Telugu
      film venture.[42] Jeevi of Idlebrain.com praised the film's first half
      while criticising the last thirty minutes of the film.[43] A critic from
      Rediff.com wrote that the film "is built up through a 'racy' screenplay
      which is gripping to an extent, but stretches to three long hours".[44] In
      2008, Babu provided voice-over for the film Jalsa directed by Trivikram
      Srinivas.[45] After Athidhi's release, Babu took a break from films for
      seven months; two months later, he signed Khaleja, but the break was
      unintentionally extended for two years due to several delays. During this
      time, Babu's grandmother and his wife Namrata's parents died. Krishna was
      worried about Babu's career as the film's shoot was delayed for so
      long.[46] The film deals with illegal-mining in India, and related
      environmental damage.[47] It marks Babu's return as an actor after a
      three-year hiatus in his second collaboration with Trivikram after Athadu.
      Upon release, Khaleja received mixed reviews from critics and was a
      commercial failure in India.[48] However, it managed to perform well at
      the overseas box office becoming the highest grossing Telugu film at that
      time.[49] Rediff gave a 3 out of 5 rating and noted "The duo of
      Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with
      good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and
      with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to
      the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his
      dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is
      effortless.[50] The film is included in the list of "25 Greatest Telugu
      Films Of The Decade" by Film Companion.[51] Stardom and career setback
      (2011–2014) In 2011, Babu collaborated with Srinu Vaitla for the film
      Dookudu along with Samantha Ruth Prabhu.[52] For his performance in the
      film, Babu won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu, his third
      Nandi Award for Best Actor,[53] and his first SIIMA Award for Best Actor
      (Telugu).[54][55] After the film's gross crossed the ₹100 crore mark
      making it the highest-grossing Telugu film of that year. The Income Tax
      Department officials conducted a raid on Babu's Jubilee Hills residence as
      he was rumoured of receiving a remuneration of more than ₹12 crore for his
      next projects.[56] He later played the role of a mafia kingpin with a
      hidden personal agenda in the film Businessman (2012), co-starring Kajal
      Aggarwal.[57] Upon the film's release, he received praise from critics for
      his performance in the film, with Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu writing,
      "The film has no frills, no vulgar wastage and the hero is practically in
      every frame; you hear only his voice, he looks good, sounds good, he also
      steals the comedian's job. Mahesh plays it straight".[58] He received his
      seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his
      second nomination for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu) for his
      performance in the film.[59][60] By then, Babu was reported to be the
      second highest-paid actor in South India after Rajinikanth.[61] Babu then
      began filming for Srikanth Addala's Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu
      (2013), whose script Babu had approved during the pre-production phase of
      Dookudu.[62] Co-starring Daggubati Venkatesh along with Anjali and
      Samantha Ruth Prabhu, it became the first Telugu multistarrer film to be
      produced in the last twenty-five years.[63] Released in January 2013, the
      film became one of the highest grossing Telugu films of the year and
      marked the completion of Babu's hat-trick of successful films.[64]
      Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called the film a "delightful family
      drama with its celebration of family bonds, love and marriage laced with
      laughter", and Addala "wants to leave his audience with a thought, wants
      them to reflect on their relationships and overlook skirmishes that can
      sour family bonds". Dundoo cited Guhan's cinematography as one of the
      film's highlights, and praised its performances.[65] He won his fourth
      Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second SIIMA Award for Best
      Actor (Telugu) for his performance in the film.[66][67] He provided a
      voice-over for Srinu Vaitla's Baadshah the same year.[68] Babu had two
      releases in 2014, the first one being Sukumar's 1: Nenokkadine, an action
      thriller focusing on a celebrity suffering from hallucinations related to
      the murder of his parents and the discovery of a special variety of
      rice.[69] Babu's performance received praise, with critics calling it one
      of his best performances.[70][71][72] For his performance, he received his
      fourth nomination for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor (Telugu).[73]
      Resurgence and recent work (2015–present) Babu collaborated with Koratala
      Siva for the action drama film Srimanthudu (2015) co-starring Shruti
      Haasan. He co-produced the film under his newly formed banner G. Mahesh
      Babu Entertainment Pvt. Ltd, marking his first film production
      venture.[74] He opted to do so to control the film's budget, accepting a
      share in profits in lieu of remuneration.[75] Released on 7 August 2015,
      Srimanthudu opened to positive reviews from critics,[76] and he won his
      fifth Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the film.[77][78]
      Sethumadhavan N. of Bangalore Mirror stated, Srimanthudu wouldn't have
      been as effective if it did not have Mahesh Babu who is at his charming
      best, adding that he "underplays the emotional scenes, making them a treat
      to watch".[79] Babu also adopted his native village, Burripalem.[80] Babu
      won third SIIMA award for best actor for his performance in the film.[81]
      In 2016, he acted in the film Brahmotsavam co-starring Kajal Aggarwal,
      Samantha Ruth Prabhu and Pranitha Subhash. Originally produced as a
      bi-lingual, the film would've marked Babu's first straight-out Tamil
      film.[82] While the film underperformed at the box office, the Deccan
      Chronicle stated that Mahesh Babu was its saving grace.[83] Mahesh babu on
      the set of Brahmotsavam (film) He later appeared in the Telugu-Tamil
      bilingual Spyder (2017), directed by A. R. Murugadoss, which finally
      marked his Tamil cinema debut[84] and grossed over ₹118 crores at the box
      office.[85] The film received mixed reviews, with praise for the cast
      performances, but criticism for its writing, screenplay and direction.[86]
      Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu stated that "Spyder starts off well but
      the director's imagination goes overboard only to turn a purpose ridden
      plot to a piece of travesty".[87] His next film was the political action
      drama Bharat Ane Nenu in 2018 where he played the role of a chief
      minister.[88] His performance in the film earned him his tenth nomination
      for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu. His next film was Maharshi
      in 2019.[89] Hemanth Kumar of Firstpost mentioned the film owes a lot to
      Mahesh Babu's conviction to pull off his role and he makes you believe in
      his characterisation so much that it doesn't feel like fiction.[90] After
      the release of the film, the concept of weekend farming (also known as
      weekend agriculture) gained more attention.[91] A new internet challenge.
      i.e. Agriculture Challenge was started, with several people do farming in
      the weekends.[92] The Statesman reported that the film has created a
      social impact on the youth and raised awareness about the issues faced by
      farmers in the rural heartland.[93] In February 2020, Rajiv Gandhi
      University of Knowledge Technologies organised the contest "Campus
      Farming". 250 students of the university participated in this contest.[94]
      Babu performed in the 2020 film Sarileru Neekevvaru, earning him an
      eleventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[95]
      The satellite rights of the film were sold to Gemini TV,[96] which
      premiered it on 25 March 2020 for the first time on eve of Ugadi and in
      its first Television premier movie recorded a TRP of 23.4.[97] He next
      began filming for Sarkaru Vaari Paata, marking his maiden collaboration
      with director Parasuram in January 2021.[98] The film was released in May
      2022 to mixed reviews from critics. Balakrishna Ganeshan of The News
      Minute gave the film a rating of 3/5 stars and wrote "It is great to see
      Mahesh Babu shedding his macho image and wooing a woman in the film.
      Mahesh is a delight to watch in these scenes. His comic timing and
      dialogue delivery are on point".[99] [100] Haricharan Pudipeddi of the
      Hindustan Times stated "Mahesh Babu offers something fresh in his latest
      film. If only Keerty Suresh could say the same.[101] In 2024, Babu
      reunited with Trivikram Srinivas for their third collaboration in the film
      Guntur Kaaram.[102] The movie was a financial failure and received mostly
      negative reviews, but Babu's performance was praised.[103][104] His next
      film will be with S. S. Rajamouli, with filming set to start in late 2024
      or early 2025.[105]
